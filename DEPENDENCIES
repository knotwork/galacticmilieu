DEPENDENCIES for GitHub-only portion of Galactic Milieu
===========================================================

This GitHub repo doesn't really have a whole lot that it
itself plans to do itself. It is more of a "tying it all
together" bundle.

It depends upon git, for sure, because it is intended to
use git to keep itself up to date.

It depends upon crontab, unless the user aka admin intends
to manually do all the various periodic chores this
repo itself and all the things it would like to use if
the are available and confured to be used want/need done
periodically.

It depends upon make, for sure, because that is how it
plans to "make" things happen. The plan is that crotnab
tells cron when to run make as well as telling cron when
to run various other things depending upon configuration.

Most likely cron will run make after doing a git pull,
but might well run make at various other times, maybe
(probably?) regularly as clockwork.

It depends upon the command line interface (cli) Open
Transactions client as a way of abstracting away all the
many and varied cryptocurrences and token systems and
so on that it would otherwise have to deal with directly
itself and to avoid the problems inherent in having
many users of the same machine all trying to access the
same blockchain-based currencies.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES
-----------------------------------------------------------

If all you want to do is interact with the economy of the
Galactic Milieu without the overhead of actually getting
involved more directly in the Milieu(s) whose economies
you are interacting with by means of Open Transactions,
I think we are done here.

However, the Galactic Milieu includes Freeciv-based
planets, so persons interested in one entire planet at a
time scale, military units large enough to take ownership
of an entire city with a single unit scale view of such
planets, with the kinds of command and control tools
persons controlling or attempting to control entire
nations on such planets, potentially even having the
entire planet under the control of one nation they and
theirs control, Freeciv is a very useful client/tool.

The scale at which Freeciv-based planets are represented
is, however, rather huge for someone who prefers to
walk around as a single individual on or off of planets.
Crossfire RPG and Battle for Wesnoth are among the tools
that have been put to use to provide more detailed,
more individual or small party scaled views into the
Milieu. Battle for Wesnoth is particularly useful for
presenting historic views: views into the past of the
Milieu.

A Crossfire RPG web-launched java-based client can be
used to access the "CrossCiv" server that should be
listed on the list of servers its metaserver presents:

ANONYMITY:

You might prefer to operate via i2p or Tor or Freenet or
you might not. Which if any such tools you prefer to use
is up to you but each will be a depency if you configure
this portion of the Galactic Milieu project to use it.
