README for GitHub-only portion of Galactic Milieu project
============================================================

This is a Git repository for a project much of which already
exists on SourceForge.

THIS IS NOT A COPY OF WHAT IS ON SOURCEFORGE.

Rather, it is at least partly, and possibly mostly, a part
of the runtime environment of the project in the sense that
being able to pick up data from a central place at runtime
can have its uses. Git and SVN were both considered for use
in such roles, I (Mark Metson) merely happen to have started
work on a Git based such resource first.

Likely an SVN based such resource will also be made, quite
likely based at SourceForge, when work on the Makefiles
and scripts for this resource reaches a point where "if
configured to use git, use the Github resource else if
configured to use svn use the SourceForge SVN resource"
becomes appropriate.

------------------------------------------------------------

This part of the project is loosely inspired by the "make
Money" concept that MakeMoney Knotwork used to try to
document. (See The Wayback Machine, makemoney.knotwork.com)

That concept was, sinply enter the command "make money"
and preto, it does its best to do so.

This one is more along the lines of "play game" or
"run game" with the word "play" and/or the word "run"
being simply a euphemism/alias for "make".

Thus I will be starting by assuming cron will be running
"make" periodically and "make" will figure out, largely
from last modified dates of files as is normal for "make",
what to actually do (such as git pull and/or svn up...)

Does that sound safe/secure to you?!?!?!

If so, please think again and/or harder!

It is not! It is stupid to run this crap! Are you out of
your mind!?!?!

Oh sure I run it, why the heck not, I write it. Oh wait,
no, I DO NOT RUN IT! Some other username on one of my
machines runs it. A disempowered user. Nonetheless, even
a disempowered user can do while fork or not fork fork
or other trivial infinite loops to eat system resources.

So don't run this crap, use it as inspiration to run
your part of the project your way or something and don't
blame me if you don't like what it does.
