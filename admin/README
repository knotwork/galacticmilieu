README for admin directory
============================================================

This is the directory the person running this install of
this GitHub repo portion of Galactic Milieu will be using
themselves. Bascially this stuff is for a human to be
using, whereas outside of this directory cron pretty much
runs the show.

------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!


Administration of the GitHub-repo portion of the Galactic
Milieu is a know what you are doing kind of deal.

Do your own due diligence. For example, don't run any
scripts without reading them first yourself to see what
it is that they intend to try to do and how they intend
to try to do it, then decide whether you actually want
them to make the attempt.



WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!

POSSIBLE BONUS!!! POSSIBLE BONUS!!! POSSIBLE BONUS!!!

If you are interested in administrating an installed
instance of the GitHub repo portion of the Galactic Milieu,
be sure to investigate any DeVCoin bounties that might
qualify you for.

In general though, since nothing in this directory should
get run without direct human oversight, the stuff in this
directory should not be of any use until the configuration
of the installation has been completed in the parent
directory.

That is to say, the stuff in here is of potential use to
people who have gotten the stuff in the parent directory
working. This directory does not contain config files
consulted by the stuff above, nor scripts etc used by
stuff above. It is for an admin who got all the stuff
above configured and working and contains stuff that
assumes all the configuring and setup the parent directory
will hopefully try to guide them through has already been
completed.
