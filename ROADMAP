============================================================
ROADMAP for GitHub-only portion of Galactic Milieu project
============================================================

This is a Git repository for a project much of which already
exists on SourceForge.

THIS IS NOT A COPY OF WHAT IS ON SOURCEFORGE.

This will be assuming cron will be running "make"
periodically and "make" will figure out, largely from last
modified dates of files as is normal for "make", what to
actually do (such as git pull and/or svn up...)

WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!

Does that sound safe/secure to you?!?!?!

If so, please think again and/or harder!

It is not! It is stupid to run this crap! Are you out of
your mind!?!?!

Oh sure I run it, why the heck not, I write it. Oh wait,
no, I DO NOT RUN IT! Some other username on one of my
machines runs it. A disempowered user. Nonetheless, even
a disempowered user can do while fork or not fork fork
or other trivial infinite loops to eat system resources.

So don't run this crap, use it as inspiration to run
your part of the project your way or something and don't
blame me if you don't like what it does.

WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!

------------------------------------------------------------

See INSTALL file for info on target platform(s) and how
to run this on them, if you're crazy enoguh to try to run
it.

------------------------------------------------------------

I am running Crossfire RPG, umpteen peer to peer crypto-
coin daemons, a bunch of eggdrop IRC bots, and have Freeciv
and Battle for Wesnoth installed but not actually running at
this moment at time of writing.

So at some point, teaching this thing to check for such
stuff in case it might want to make (pun intended) use of
some of it is probably on the agenda.

------------------------------------------------------------

If its initial assumption is that make will be run, then
obviously it is dead-on-arrival unless make is in fact
present and will in fact do as expected with the Makefile
that obviously must be first item on the roadmap.

At time of writing I haven't started on that initial
Makefile yet...
