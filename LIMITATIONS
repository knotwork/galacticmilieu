LIMITATIONS of GitHub-only portion of Galactic Milieu
===========================================================

Unless we use encrypted messages/data, git is not really
an ideal way of distributing data to each user that is
tailored for that user.

For example we can include general information that the
universe at large has access to, but unless we encryt we
cannot readily have entities who have no spies in a
certain region be unable to get any reports from that
region, stuff like that.

It is best used for "broadcastable" data, and for that
kind of data it has the virtue of being pulled by those
who choose to pull it instead of being pushed to those
who might prefer not to have it pushed at them.

Furthermore, GitHub caters to open data; encrypting
data so only certain parties can actually unencrypt
certain parts of it, so as to use it as a carrier for
messages targeted at specific nyms or something like that,
would be an abuse of the service.

Probably for that kind of thing we should have [at least
some] nodes install not only git client but also git
repos, where they can put in encypted form outgoing
messages intended for specific other nodes to pull.
