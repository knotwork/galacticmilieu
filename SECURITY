SECURITY for GitHub-only portion of Galactic Milieu
============================================================

AT SOME POINT we should separate getting the latest news
about what is going on out in the Milieu on other machines
from keeping this code up to date.

Currently though, getting code up to date is pretty much
the top item on the agenda out in the Milieu, partly
because we do not yet have code for cron / crontab to
actually use to keep up to date with other happenings out
in the Milieu.

Having this automatic updating of this code happening
will hopefully allow code for getting news about other
types of activities going on out there to get here and
get run.

Open Transactions is supposed to be used for transaction
processing, as that gets integrated more and more its
own security, which is intended to be quite good, should
help us evolve toward better and better security over
the coming timespans.
