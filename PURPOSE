PURPOSE for GitHub-only portion of Galactic Milieu project
============================================================

This is a Git repository for a project much of which already
exists on SourceForge.

THIS IS NOT A COPY OF WHAT IS ON SOURCEFORGE.

This will be assuming cron will be running "make"
periodically and "make" will figure out, largely from last
modified dates of files as is normal for "make", what to
actually do (such as git pull and/or svn up...)

WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!

Does that sound safe/secure to you?!?!?!

If so, please think again and/or harder!

It is not! It is stupid to run this crap! Are you out of
your mind!?!?!

Oh sure I run it, why the heck not, I write it. Oh wait,
no, I DO NOT RUN IT! Some other username on one of my
machines runs it. A disempowered user. Nonetheless, even
a disempowered user can do while fork or not fork fork
or other trivial infinite loops to eat system resources.

So don't run this crap, use it as inspiration to run
your part of the project your way or something and don't
blame me if you don't like what it does.

WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!

------------------------------------------------------------

Surely is it obvious at a glance that the purpose is to
take control of your computer, or at least one user on your
computer. ;) :D

It is all part of Tux and Tuxette's implementation of
their part in carrying out the Grand Plan of Linus (GPL):
taking over the world.

The rest is mere implementation details. :)

This GitHub-only portion of the Galactic Milieu project
exists for the purpose of distributing information to
(and probably among) a distributed / federated network of
nodes at runtime. Toward that end, it is currently being
used to distribute infrastructure items aimed at providing
some purpose to distributung information at runtime.

By that I mean there is not much point distributing
application / federation data if no infrastructure such
as code and scripts exists at the nodes. Without stuff
that makes use of the distributable data there is little
demand for the data.

So the current-stage purpose is to get installed at the
nodes stuff that will actually have some use for the kinds
of data that we figure on having nodes grab using git
at runtime.

If we look at the Galactic Milieu as if it were a game or
a milieu of multiple games, we can regard the kind of data
we plan on pulling at runtime as things like intergalactic
news and espionage reports, reports from starships
our players might have "out there somewhere" on missions,
economy reports about worlds other than such worlds as
we might ourselves be hosting on our own machine... stuff
like that.

If we look at the Galactic Nexus Uberplan (GNU) as an
overarching plan to navigate and/or manipulate timelines
toward some specific Temporal Nexus, that might bring
to mind distributing such data was what military forces
are deployed where, by whom, and what technologies they
are known to have access to, and stuff like that.

For example, what would a Freeciv presentation of the
current deployment of technologies and military units on
Sol III look like? A "modern Earth" scenario for Freeciv,
in effect, that is.

Freeciv could be used as a sktchpad to sketch out theories
ideas plans etc about any planet. DIstributing such a tool
under the guise of a game is a part of the Galactic Nexus
Uberplan that some GNUites apparently imagine to be quite
clever.

Of course we could set up UUCP+USENET software on nodes
to distribute info, it just so happens that this GitHub-
only portion of the Galactic Milieu project chooses to use
git itself, being as how those who have downloaded a
GitHub-only repo might well turn out to already have git
installed.

A lot of the overall purpose is, of course, to have fun.

Characterising it all as games or a game might help to
accomplish that, who knows? Lets give it a whirl and see.
