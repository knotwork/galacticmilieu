README for home/gm dir of GitHub-only portion of Galactic
	Milieu project
============================================================

This is an example/sample homedirectory for a dedicated
Galactic Milieu user (whose username need not be "gm").

Such a user would be the one whose crontab is used to
run the cron tasks for example.

It should not be the same user that runs your Open
Transactions server if you run such a server, and probably
just on general principles probably should not even be the
one that runs your Crossfire RPG server if you run such a
server nor the one that runs your Freeciv server if you
run such a server.

------------------------------------------------------------

Personally I have developed the custom of having a
run-at-reboot.sh script for each user that has stuff that
should be fired up by that user at boot/reboot. I use their
~/cmds/ directory to keep such scripts in.

I also tend to make them normal users instead of trying to
put their homedir somewhere less normal than /home/username
because I give them a normal shell. I had myt crossfire
user set to use /var/games/crossfire as its home directory
and when I got around to giving that user a normal shell
so I could log in as that user to do development as that
user I noticed it got an error trying to cd into its
homedirectory at login.

Thus on migrating to my new machine with newer version
of Fedora Core on it (I am on Fedora Core 15 as I write)
I created a normal user named crossfire so that error at
human login would no longer disturb my wah.
