INSTALL for GitHub-only portion of Galactic Milieu project
============================================================

This is a Git repository for a project much of which already
exists on SourceForge.

THIS IS NOT A COPY OF WHAT IS ON SOURCEFORGE.

This will be assuming cron will be running "make"
periodically and "make" will figure out, largely from last
modified dates of files as is normal for "make", what to
actually do (such as git pull and/or svn up...)

WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!

Does that sound safe/secure to you?!?!?!

If so, please think again and/or harder!

It is not! It is stupid to run this crap! Are you out of
your mind!?!?!

Oh sure I run it, why the heck not, I write it. Oh wait,
no, I DO NOT RUN IT! Some other username on one of my
machines runs it. A disempowered user. Nonetheless, even
a disempowered user can do while fork or not fork fork
or other trivial infinite loops to eat system resources.

So don't run this crap, use it as inspiration to run
your part of the project your way or something and don't
blame me if you don't like what it does.

WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!

------------------------------------------------------------

Initially I am just going to assume this will be run on a
Linux box not much different from my own, and that any
differences from my own are "somebody else's problem".

------------------------------------------------------------

My own happens to be a 64-bit Fedora Core 15 box at time of
writing. In case you might have wondered.

------------------------------------------------------------

I am running Crossfire RPG, umpteen peer to peer crypto-
coin daemons, a bunch of eggdrop IRC bots, and have Freeciv
and Battle for Wesnoth installed but not actually running at
this moment at time of writing.

------------------------------------------------------------

If you are running a similar box, you might be able to
simply clone this github project and run "make", if I have
actually included a Makefile by the tiem you read this.

------------------------------------------------------------

BUT SHEESH! ARE YOU FOOL ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY DO THAT?!?!

If so, why not bite the whole biscuit: tell cron to do
a make periodically. Hopefully it will be clever enough
(someday anyway) to clue you in about doing that, if it
is clever enough to figure out whether you already did it.

The rest, as they say, will be history. Catastrophe? Fun?
Merely an automated attempt to try to keep up with some
aspects of the Galact Milieu? Run it -or "simply read
the code"- and see, AT YOUR OWN RISK, AFTER DOING YOUR
OWN DUE DILIGENCE, if at all.
