CONSPIRACY for GitHub-only portion of Galactic Milieu
============================================================

The author(s) of this crap must think we are total morons
if they think we will have crontab automatically git pull
anything that will get executed.

So lets conspire to prevent execution of anything on our
own machines that we didn't inspect for ourselves with due
diligence before allowing it to be executed.

This whole shebang can, to that end, stay in /usr/src
owned by root, who can even make it unreadable by other
users.

We can hack the make routines to ensure ourselves that
git pull on autpilot by other users actually only happens
someplace in var or home, and only if nothing that is
pulled in that way gets executed.

We can fork the actual data-payload-carrying spots/dirs
into a separate, or even various separate, git repos,
for pulling totally separate from this code/scripts
repo.

Some version-synchronisation will be wanted to make sure
we don't run old code/scripts on data that is for newer
versions and might not work in older versions.

In fact, part of the runtime data to be distributed should
probably be reports as to which nodes are known to have
upgraded to which versions of what, to help in deciding
what versions of what kinds of data each node can process
thus what kinds of data they might be interested in and/or
we might be interested in helping them to become interested
in.
