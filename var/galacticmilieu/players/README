README for var/galacticmilieu/players directory

This is where we will stash info about players.

------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!

Some of the info we stash here will come from httpdrops
and/or httpsdrops other players set up to leave data in
for players interested in what they choose to "let drop"
in such places.

THUS WE MUST AT ALL TIMES BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT PLAYERS
MANAGE TO INSINUATE INTO SUCH DATA.

Even if we tried real hard not to pick up any nasties when
picking up stuff drop drops, we might be well advised to
do really good due diligence any time we think about making
use of such info too.

Maybe we will do a var/spool type thing eventually for
initial processing of players' drops, to try to only put
in here safe info we have thoroughly vetted. But at time
of writing that is/was not in place yet.
